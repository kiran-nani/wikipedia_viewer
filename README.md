### A search UI utilizing wikipedia's API to display ten results of user-driven search.

This was one of my favorite projects from the intermediate challenge sections of freeCodeCamp, so once I completed my front end certification, I decided to upgrade it with some of my improved skills.

I coded my original with basic HTML, Bootstrap, and jQuery. I wanted to redo it with as few libraries/frameworks as possible. 

This version was coded with HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. That said, I did utilize the sliding animations from [Animate.css](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/). Since I knew I would only need 2 animations, I pulled them out of the entire file so as not to include code I was not using.

This is 'complete' in the sense that it works how I want it to, but only in desktop versions of Chrome, Firefox, and Opera.

I will need to research and include a polyfill for Safari desktop as well as mobile browsers.
